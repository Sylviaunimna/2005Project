  <h1>Introduction</h1>    

    <h2>Project Description</h2>
    <p>The client is the instructor for COMP2005 course at the Computer
         Science        
         Department, Memorial University of Newfoundland</p>
    <p>The project description presented by the client is as follows:
        <blockquote>The COMP2005 course involves use of tools and environments  
        which students have to "pick-up" along the way, with limited instruction.
        This presents a challenge for students at different levels of
        experience with software development. I would like them to have a 
        collaborative tool for exchanging information on materials, tutorials, 
        tools, organization and other helpful resources or links. It should be 
        along the lines of other software development forums such as Stack 
        Overflow. </blockquote> </p>
    <p>The project team is a group of up to 4 students registered in COMP2005 
        for the Winter 2018 semester. </p>

    <h2>Team Members</h2>
        <p>The project team is a group of 4 students registered in COMP2005 for the Winter 2018 semester:
            <ul>
                <li>Caleb Graves</li>
                <li>Daniel Harris</li>
                <li>Gwang-Seop Shin</li>
                <li>Sylvia Unimna</li>
            </ul></p>  

    <h2>Functional Features Chosen by the Team</h2>
        <p>The following list of functional features are to be implemnted in our prototype:
            <ul>
                <li>User password authentication</li>
                <li>Creation and editing of their own postings and topics by authenticated users.</li>
                <li>User subscription to topics and subsequent notification of new posts</li>
                <li>Creation of discussion groups (selected users) and optional restriction of topics to created groups.</li>
            </ul>
        Further breakdown of these features can be found below in the requirements list.</p> 


    <h2>Methodology</h2>
        <p>Accepted techniques for requirements gathering include:
            <ul>
                <li>Client interview</li>
                <li>User group dicussion</li>
                <li>User stories</li>
                <li>UML use case analysis</li>
            </ul></p>
        <p>
  <p> The requirements for our prototype are distinguishable by a special symbol <i class="glyphicon glyphicon-user"></i> under the "verify by" tab.</p>
